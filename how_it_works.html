    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      Syllabus Query System is built to help students quickly find the subject, module, and relevant content 
      for any academic question based on their uploaded syllabus. Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload the Syllabus PDF</strong>: Users begin by uploading the official Third Year 
        Computer Engineering syllabus PDF. The system verifies whether the uploaded file is valid and 
        then extracts and processes all subject and module data from it.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Ask a Question</strong>: After the syllabus is uploaded and verified, users can enter any 
        syllabus-related question into the input box. This could be a theoretical question, a keyword, or 
        even a brief topic phrase.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Module and Subject Detection</strong>:<br/>
        Based on the question, the system detects and displays the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Subject name</li>
          <li>Module number</li>
          <li>Matched module content</li>
        </ul>
        This helps users know exactly where their question fits within the syllabus.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Video Resource Integration</strong>:<br/>
        To enhance learning, the system fetches relevant educational videos from YouTube based on the 
        detected topic or module. These videos appear alongside the text results.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Search History</strong>:<br/>
        For logged-in users, all queries are saved to their personal history. This allows them to revisit 
        previous questions and track their learning progress over time.
      </li>
    </ol>
